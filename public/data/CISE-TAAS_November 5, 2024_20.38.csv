In data engineering and database management, I focus on building and optimizing data pipelines, data architecture, and the effective use of SQL for handling large datasets. I’ve applied these skills in projects requiring complex data processing, such as fabricating a code-mixed dataset for multilingual sentiment analysis, which involved advanced annotation and preprocessing.

With operating systems and computer networks, I am particularly drawn to understanding the underlying infrastructure that enables efficient, secure data flow and system interactions. My coursework in Distributed Operating Systems helped me deepen my understanding of these principles, which I have applied in structuring backend processes to ensure scalable and reliable applications.

In human-computer interaction and user experience design, my experience spans designing responsive and user-friendly interfaces in high-stakes settings. For instance, my work at Voloridge included creating trading widgets within the Workspace Manager platform, where I applied HCI principles to enhance traders’ interactions with the software. These experiences align with my focus on software engineering practices, including collaborating with team members, implementing robust input validation with Zod, and ensuring quality with tools like Jira and Bitbucket.

Advanced data structures play a significant role in my problem-solving approach, especially when implementing efficient algorithms for data manipulation and retrieval. My knowledge of data structures has been foundational in optimizing applications for high performance, contributing to user experience and functionality.

In data science and machine learning, I am particularly interested in applying models to solve real-world problems, such as computer vision tasks for agricultural robot development and sentiment analysis on social media data. I have a solid foundation in user-centered design principles that I apply across projects to create intuitive interfaces, as seen in my ongoing work to design an advising website tailored to students’ course planning needs.

Across all of these domains, I’m motivated by a desire to leverage my technical skills to create innovative, efficient, and user-centered solutions that solve practical problems.",COP 5536 – Adv Data Structures – Prof. Sahni Sartaj Kumar,COP 3530 – Data Struc/Algorithms – Prof. Zhou Lisha,CAP 5100 – Human-Comp Interact – Prof. Ruiz Jaime,CAP 5771 – Intro to Data Science – Prof. Jiang Zhe,CEN 3031 – Intro Software Engr – Prof. Rani Neha
